Lua is a small, fast, powerful, and embeddable scripting language. It is
well-suited for use in video games, application scripting, embedded devices, and
nearly anywhere else a scripting language is needed. This quick reference
contains a wealth of knowledge on how to program in and embed Lua, whether it is
Lua 5.4, 5.3, 5.2, or 5.1. This book can even be used with LuaJIT, a
Just-In-Time compiler for Lua based on Lua 5.1. *Lua Quick Reference* groups the
language's features and C API in a convenient and easy-to-use manner, while
clearly marking the differences between Lua versions.

This book covers:

* Lua syntax, expressions, and statements
* Metatables and metamethods
* Object-oriented programming with Lua
* Creating and working with Lua and C Modules
* Lua's standard library and its C API
* Collaborative multi-threading in Lua and C
* How to embed and use Lua within a host
* And much more

Mitchell commands over 15 years of experience programming in and embedding Lua
in both the corporate and open-source realms.
